    "  - Facebook, Inc. is an American social media conglomerate founded in 2005 by Mark Zuckerberg with 2 other classmates from Harvard University. People from different countries, ethinicities, cultures, age groups, interact and use facebook on a daily basis. The company however wants to increase the opportunity for users to use Facebook for social media campaigns, for small and big businesses and also enable users to generate effective leads. As a result, they have collected usage data for different age groups, the device they use , the likes they recieve and give and also the number of friends they have or the requests they have initiated. This will help facebook personalise the experience of users more, help them track patterns that will increase enagagement, improve app features and/or website features etc.\n",
    "  - To tackle this problem, Facebook has hired a data engineer to find patterns and derive meaningful insights.\n",

    "- We then performed post profiling to observe any changes.\n",
    "- Then , we went ahead and conducted EDA. Here we added one more column called age_group.\n",
    "- We then based our observations on the age_group division, gender division, likes recieved and given, populatity of females and males, their usage patterns, the people who are most addicted and so on.\n",

There are a few outliers at >250000 likes for a lesser friend count. These are probably social media influencers , bloggers, or any other celebrity figure.\n",

    "- Through EDA and associated visualisations we relaised that the age group which uses Facebook more actively is between 20- 30 years of age and they use the mobile app more frequently. Web usage however is spread over a wider age group implying that social media features on the website are more user friendly, easy to use and interactive. Further analysis can be conducted to identify the different pages they visit , the businesses they have setup and are active on, and also how social media campaigns have gathered pace over the last few years. This will help Facebook improve their user base and also help achieve the target of increasing Facebook usage commercially.\n"

    "- Highest and Lowest age groups in the dataset are 113 and 13.\n",
    "- Total number of Females, Males , Not sure category in each age group.\n",
    "- Highest number of items are in the age group of 45+, and minimum is in the age group of 35-44\n",
    "- The female age group has a higher spread of data than males and the central tendency is also higher.\n",
    "- MAles in the age group of 18-24 are the most popular with a substantially high number of likes recieved, while for females the spread is between 11 to 20 years.\n",
    "- For Friendships initiated of less than 1000 , the number of likes recieved is high. However, it keeps decreasing with a very high number of friendships initiated.\n",
    "- People in the age group between 20 and 30 have the maximum likes given through mobile access.\n",
    "- People in the age group between 18 and 24 have the maximum likes given through www access and females seem to be more addicted.\n",
    "- Younger females and males seem to recieve a higher number of likes than the rest. - thus implying age does have an impact on popularity.\n",
    "- There is a negative relationship between www likes and mobile likes given. This indicates that most individuals access facebook using only one device.\n",
    "- There is a high corelation between friend count and friendships initiated.\n",
    "- There is a high corelation between mobile likes given and total number of likes given, and low corelation between the www likes given and the total likes given.\n",
    "- There is a high corelation between mobile likes recived and total number of likes recieved, which is slightly greater than the corelation between www likes revieved and total likes recieved.\n",
    "- Data regarding the different pages visited by users, along with frequency and time of the day could have helped us in our goal of increasing facebook usability to improve social media marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9.3 Suggestions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spread of data for females is between 20 and 55 years of age and for males it is between 20 to 45 years of age. Hence, this is the spread that we should be focussing our efforts on.\n",
    "- Younger males seem to be more enagaged hence further analysis can be done to identify their behavioural patterns and the content they enagage with , implying higher social media presence.\n",
    "- Organic reach has dropped on almost every social media platform in recent years. However, accounts with higher social media engagement are the least affected. In fact, Facebook uses “meaningful engagement” as an important signal that a post should be prioritized. Hence people with higher number of posts/ likes given should be prioritized more.\n",
    "- Popular males and females belonging to a certain age group ( 18-22 ) approx have the highest number of likes recieved. Hence , closely analysing their social media presence with time of the day,the different pages they have created, their personalities etc can be tracked and social media analytics can play a vital role in it.\n",
    "- Usage of mobile device to access facebook is high for people in the age group of 18 to 30. However, for high number of likes given through the web, seems to be spread till the age of 65-70 years. Therefore it is inevitable that the web access is easier or much more comfortable for a larger population than the mobile app. This implies that work needs to be done to make the mobile app easy to use with interactive features.\n",
    "- In order to encourage users to interact with facebook more for social media marketing, it is important to gather further data on small and large business pages on facebook and how different individuals are leveraging facebook for it."
